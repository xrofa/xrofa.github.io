# Why V3? 

[V2](https://docs.usercentrics.com/#/browser-cmp) was created with the Browser SDK and minimal package size in mind. While the SDK proved to be a good idea, the package size of both UI & SDK increased over time.

This creates performance issues and makes it difficult to achieve good Core Web Vitals / Lighthouse results.

The **CMP V3** addresses and solves these problems.

## How are the improvements achieved?

### V2
All business logic reside within the Browser SDK.

The information is spread across multiple files, representing multiple domains of business logic (core, dps, settings, translation, tcf vendors list, etc.).

### V3
Critical parts of the above-mentioned business logic have been moved to a backend API, which produces tailored responses for all of our customers.

This API returns many of the actual properties that were previously calculated on the SDK, in one cacheable JSON response. 

## Performance Metrics

**V3** shows great improvements in all business-critical areas: In comparison with V2, **V3** reduces the kB transferred in the client by ~70% and the amount of network requests performed by ~60%.
The smaller fingerprint of this CMP, results in better Lighthouse scores & Core Web Vitals.
