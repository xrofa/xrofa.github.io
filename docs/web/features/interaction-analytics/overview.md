## Interaction Analytics vs. Granular Analytics

Usercentrics provides two different ways to gain detailed insights into your users' behaviour: Interaction Analytics and Granular Analytics.

!!! info "Interaction Analytics"
    **Interaction Analytics** gives you insights into how users react to your CMP and allows you to monitor the impact of setup changes you make. The Interaction Analytics Dashboard provides you with general KPIs of the CMP on your website, such as Interaction Rates or Accept All Rates. The provided data and graphs allow you to take data-driven business decisions and help you

    * to easily keep track of the most relevant KPIs.
    * to monitor the overall success of your CMP strategy.
    * to get insights on how the CMP setup impacts the interactions of your website users.


!!! info "Granular Analytics"
    **Granular Analytics** provides you with granular data based on single consent decisions for Data Processing Services. Consent decisions are explicit decisions made by users who have interacted with the CMP by clicking Accept, Deny or Save. Users who do not interact with the CMP do not take any consent decisions. The provided data and graphs allow you to get the full picture of your users' behaviour and help you

    * to identify the right category for your DPS to improve the consent for specific services.
    * to better understand how the consent rate for individual DPS is composed in order to improve your data-driven decision-making.
