# Google Additional Consent

## What is Google Additional Consent?

Googleâ€™s Additional Consent is a technical specification designed to enable publishers to collect and signal additional consent for ad tech providers that are not part of the IAB Europeâ€™s Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) v2.2, but are listed on Googleâ€™s Ad Tech Providers (ATPs) [list](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9012903?sjid=6541888267895389824-EU). This specification is crucial for publishers that want to work with ad tech providers not using the TCF.
It is important to note that Googleâ€™s Additional Consent does not replace the standard IAB TCF v2.2 consent collection process, but supplements it, enabling an extra layer of consent collection for Google ATPs.

The Google Additional Consent V2 supports an Additional Consent (AC) String and to allow interoperability for CMPs that support TCF and Advertiser Consent Mode. For more information, please refer to this [guide](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9681920?hl=en).
