# Consent Choice Persistence

!!! note "Feature introduced in version 2.13.0"

The Consent Choice Persistence feature is designed to streamline the user experience across different geographies by ensuring that consent preferences provided in one location are
seamlessly preserved and applied when the user moves to another region **where they have previously given consent**.

This means that once users consent to data collection in one city or country, they won't be prompted to provide consent again if they travel to another area covered by their
initial consent.

This feature not only enhances user convenience by eliminating repetitive consent requests, but also ensures that users' preferences are consistently 
respected, regardless their location.

## Implementation Guide

Activating the Consent Choice Persistence feature is achieved by using Rulesets, requiring no additional setup through the Admin Interface or SDK adjustments.

This seamless integration ensures that once Rulesets are in place, the feature operates effortlessly, guided by Usercentrics' robust platform.

Usercentrics offers a versatile toolkit for tailoring consent frameworks based on user location, customizing consent banner appearances, and adjusting settings to fit your needs.
This hands-off approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining precise control over consent management across different regions.
