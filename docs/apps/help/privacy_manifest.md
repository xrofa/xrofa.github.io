#Apple's Privacy Manifest files

## Introduction

Apple's new privacy requirements center around documenting the data collected by your app, referred to as the **Privacy Manifest**. This manifest provides details on the data categories collected by your app and third-party SDKs, along with the purposes behind data collection.

Third-party SDKs **must include a privacy manifest** file named `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`. This property list records the data types collected and the reasons for using corresponding APIs.

**No, we do not collect any data deemed by Apple as significant for inclusion in the manifest.**
