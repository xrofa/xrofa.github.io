Our SDK consists of 2 main components:

:   Contains all core functionality to collect, document and manage consent, as well as usability features like language detection and geolocation. You may use this component by itself, if you are planing to build your own UI.

**UsercentricsUI**
:   UI Component that hooks to our UsercentricsCore to provide a ready to use consent banner solution. This component is design to own all the complexity of compliance, while also providing several levels of customization.
